A seasoned full-stack developer predominately in the WordPress space, with over 5 years commercial experience in the digital marketing industry.

I'm leading company-wide change by creating solutions for problems ranging from simple to complex requirements. These include implementing automated development workflows, optimising marketing teams efficiency and saving costs by adopting long-term strategies.

I've pushed modern technologies such as a Next.js frontend with a GraphQL connection to a WordPress backend. Today, this architecture caters for our largest account, a collection of ~50 care homes, where scalability is a key factor for success.

I've developed a Web SDK in-house during my time at boxChilli, which has become an integral part of day-to-day operations. The biggest achievement of the SDK by far is the commitment to impactful change in an era of automation and forward-thinking, with plans to explore AI integration.

Away from the screens, Iâ€™m an avid car guy who is always happy to be the designated driver. Youâ€™ll regularly find me outdoors exploring, having climbed Snowdon and Scafell Pike in 2022.
